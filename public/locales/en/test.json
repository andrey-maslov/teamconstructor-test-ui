In each of them, you need to choose which of the two statements is closer to you, where 1 - the first statement is unambiguously closer, 5 - the second statement is unambiguously closer, 3 - both statements are equally close / far.</p><p>THERE ARE NO WRONG ANSWERS. This test will help us to better understand your behavioral and communication skills, which will allow us to develop an individual approach and find the best partners for you. There are no wrong people either, there are just inappropriate combinations. Therefore, take the test answers seriously, but at the same time try to pass it in a calm, stress-free environment. The questionnaire will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</p>",
